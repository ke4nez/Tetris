# Tetris Project - JavaScript Implementation

## Project Description

This is my semester project — a classic Tetris game implemented in pure JavaScript with an original twist. The game includes a special block — a **bomb**, which explodes upon landing and destroys all blocks within a 3-cell radius, adding strategy and excitement to the classic gameplay.

## Controls

- **W / S** — Move up/down
- **A / D** — Move left/right
- **Q / E** — Rotate left/right (alternative control)
- **Others** — Standard block falling and locking behavior
